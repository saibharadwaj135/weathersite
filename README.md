# weathersite

This website is designed to retrieve weather details for a specific city entered by the user. It leverages a Weather API to fetch real-time weather data for the chosen city. The frontend is crafted using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface, while the backend is powered by Node.js and expressJs. Additionally, embedded JavaScript (EJS) is employed to dynamically render weather information on the website. The website is hosted on Heroku.
